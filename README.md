# Spotify Stats

A Spotify Wrapped like website.



## About the project

I wanted to make an actually useful website with all the skills I learned in the past month. I only realized at the very end that I couldn't make this site publicly usable, because of Spotify's very strict rules. Anyways I will still host it here so at least it can be viewed.

At first this project would have been an Electron application, but knowing that it wouldn't be usable anyway, it stays being website. I used Typescript for the API call handling then React for the rest with Tailwindcss for styling.
